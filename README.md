# WindowsBatch
*Full of a mishmash of Windows Batch projects. Larger ones get their own repositories.*

[Batch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batch_file) is one of those low-level odd programming languages that is fun to mess with. With some clever things such as [console virtual terminal sequences](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences?redirectedfrom=MSDN), you can do some very interesting things with it. Because batch is an interpreted language, it is very slow. It also cannot handle floats. If it could handle some higher-level arithmetic (sin, cos, floats, etc.) and was a significant bunch faster, I could definitly make a 3d game engine.
